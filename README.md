# **Jackson's Fans Page**
For this project is about a singer who named Jackson Wang and this website will be for the site's users which is *fans and potential fans* who wish to learn more about Jackson's history. Other than that, the event that the singer going to participate in or any information about him will also in that website.

Besides, his albulm will also be selling at this website. As it also make the fans can buy his albulm at a very fair price.

## Design Process
The insight into my design process for this is that while it's not hard to just make a website, it's not easy to make it look good and neat. I designed this site mainly for Jackson Wang fan Jacky. Although the internet is now so advanced that you can find anything you want online, it would be great if there was a single website for the Jacky's to discuss and share with each other. And for those who are new to the Jacky fans, they may not know much about Jackson's previous history or achievements. This site would make it easy for them to get up to speed. The site will also allow them to exchange information about Jackson or photos and videos that they have. I also sell Jackson's albums on this site, which helps some fans to be able to buy Jackson's albums.

As a fan base that is still young, I can't necessarily afford to go to any of Jackson's offline events such as concerts, signings, meet and greets, etc. Through this site, I can get first-hand news and photos or videos.

As a teenage fan base, I am able to attend Jackson's offline events. And I want to share my work, but there's no platform for me to do so.
